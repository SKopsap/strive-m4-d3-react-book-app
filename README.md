Pair Programming - State & Props
PAIR PROGRAMMING EXERCISE. 1 DRIVER, 1 NAVIGATOR.
Exercise each. Use GitHub to share the code.

1. Starting by creating a new React app by using the command create-react-app.
2. Include into your project bootstrap + react-bootstrap
3. Create a component called WarningSign which receives some text as a prop. This text should be presented inside an Alert of type danger.
4. Create a component called MyBadge which receives a text and a color as props. This component should render a Badge react-bootstrap component with those properties.
5. Create a SingleBook component as a function. The component receives a book object as a prop, and displays the cover and the title of the book. Use react-bootstrap Cards to display a book (The book object can be read from one of the .json book files we gave you yesterday).
6. Create a BookList component. This component receives by props a list of books and displays them using the SingleBook component.
7. Create a FilterBookList feature. By writing into an input field a search query, the BookList should show only the books with the specified string into the title (save the query into the BookList component state and filter the books accordingly).
8. Convert your SingleBook component to a class, and create its state containing a 'selected' boolean property.
9. Clicking on a SingleBook should toggle its 'selected' state property. If the 'selected' property is true, the SingleBook should have some styling that reflects that state change, visually.
   Push everything on GitHub and publish it on Eduflow before 17:00 CET.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
